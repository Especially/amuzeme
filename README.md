## Let your mood pick your playlist for you.

A full stack Spotify application which employs React(Hooks), Express, FireBase and Node.js.

This application allows users to take selfies, and through the Microsoft Face AI api, their mood is determined. The user has the option to use text input as another option which uses IBM Watson's Tone Analyzer to provide a mood based off of text input. Users can save their playlists and play them in-app, and view their playlist history by clicking on their profile.
